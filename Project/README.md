# Smart Bins

## Inspiration
Taking a look at the current world scenario, we noticed that it would be really clever to educate organizations or groups of people regarding the importance of Waste Segregation. If we continue with our current disposal methods (incorrect practices), then soon will we find our planet in an extremely deteriorated state; in the present decade. 

## How does Smart Bins help solve this issue?
Well, Smart Bins lets you segregate waste into six major categories, i.e. hazardous, biomedical, household, electronic, recyclable, and green waste. It is a website that will help users understand the type of waste they are disposing and therefore the users can go about slecting an appropriate method of disposal for that particular waste/waste category. 

## Challenges we ran into?
It was an ordeal task for us to find data regaring waste segregation on the internet. Classifying waste based off their type was something we had to look up multiple times. Last off, hosting the website on heroku turned out to be very confusing because it was our first time deploying the website on the web, and also was it challenging to find relevant youtube videos providing a fix to the issue. Nevertheless, we are proud of ourselves that we could successfully make our website completely working and also could host it on the internet!

## What is next for Smart Bins 2.0?
We were thinking of helping the users further, to a point that they understand the right disposal methods along with the classification of waste(s). Achieving that will educate the people a lot, enough to take us a step closer to the goal of achieving a "clean planet".
