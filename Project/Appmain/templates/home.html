        <h2>Why do we need Smart Bins?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #5d6063"> Currently, about 2.01 billion metric tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) are produced
            annually worldwide. The World Bank estimates overall waste generation will increase to 3.40
            billion metric tons by 2050. Based on the volume of waste generated, its composition, and how
            it is managed, it is estimated that 1.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent
            greenhouse gas emissions were generated from solid waste treatment and disposal in 2016,
            or 5 percent of global emissions. This is driven primarily by disposing of waste in open
            dumps and landfills without landfill gas collection systems. Food waste accounts for nearly
            50% of emissions. Solid waste–related emissions are anticipated to increase to 2.38 billion
            tonnes of CO2-equivalent per year by 2050 if no improvements are made in the sector.

  <div class="Classification">
    <h2><em>Some different types of wastes</em></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        RADIOACTIVE WASTE
      </li>

      <p>
        Radioactive waste is a type of hazardous waste that contains radioactive material. Radioactive waste is a result
        of many activities, including nuclear medicine, nuclear research, nuclear power generation, rare-earth mining,
        and nuclear weapons reprocessing.
      </p>
      <li>INDUSTRIAL WASTE</li>
      <p>Industrial waste is the waste produced by industrial activity which includes any material that is rendered
        useless during a manufacturing process such as that of factories, mills, and mining operations. Types of
        industrial waste include dirt and gravel, masonry and concrete</p>
      <LI> BIOMEDICAL WASTE</LI>
      <p>Biomedical waste is defined as any type of waste created during a diagnostic process, the treatment of a
        condition or disease, or immunizations of humans or animals. It also includes any research activities or
        processes that involve biological testing. In essence, it’s any type of waste that contains any type of material
        that may be contaminated with potentially infectious properties. </p>
      <li>DOMESTIC WASTE</li>
      <P>Domestic waste is waste that is generated as a result of the ordinary day-to-day use of a domestic premise and
        is either:

        taken from the premises by or on behalf of the occupier who generated the waste; without consideration (e.g.
        payment, reward or other benefit); or
        collected by or on behalf of a local government as part of a waste collection and disposal system</P>
